/**
 * Cross-Site Bridge Instrumentation
 *
 * Instruments the shared cross-site link engine ONCE so every consumer — the
 * blog bridge, the events bridge, the news-wire bridge, and the taxonomy /
 * artist-profile cross-site renderers — inherits two sibling measurements
 * without any per-consumer code:
 *
 *   1. CLICK event   — fires on the first click per cross-site link element and
 *                      page load.
 *                      Measures *intent*. Prefetch/prerender can fake a UTM
 *                      arrival at the destination but cannot fake a real
 *                      pointer click in a rendered, JS-executing browser.
 *
 *   2. IMPRESSION event — fires once per link element and page load when at
 *                      least 50% of the element enters the viewport. Browsers
 *                      without IntersectionObserver use a scroll/resize check
 *                      bounded to 30 seconds. A click emits a still-missing
 *                      impression first because the interaction proves
 *                      exposure.
 *
 * Client-side dedupe targets one click attempt per viewport-exposed opportunity,
 * but the sibling events use independent best-effort requests. Stored rows can
 * be missing under asymmetric loss or duplicated by a retry after an ambiguous
 * failure, so their quotient is a stored click-to-exposure ratio, not a
 * mathematically bounded CTR. Both are gated on the same "JS executed in a real
 * browser" signal, so neither is bot-inflated the way the raw UTM
 * `network_bridge` channel is (see extrachill-network#58).
 *
 * NO AJAX (system rule). The browser ships both events with
 * `navigator.sendBeacon()` (fire-and-forget, survives navigation) to the
 * canonical extrachill-api analytics routes — clicks to /analytics/click
 * (click_type=bridge), impressions to /analytics/impression
 * (impression_type=bridge). Those thin wrappers record via the network-wide
 * `extrachill/track-analytics-event` ability owned by extrachill-analytics.
 *
 * This file owns ONLY the client: enqueue, localize, and the sendBeacon JS.
 * The REST receiver lives in extrachill-api (the canonical REST home for
 * ability wrappers) — see extrachill-network#62.
 *
 * @package ExtraChillNetwork
 * @since 1.18.0

/**
 * Enqueue the bridge instrumentation script on bridge-capable front-end views.
 *
 * Singular views and network homepages can both act as cross-site routers. The
 * script self-gates at runtime: it observes only bridge links present when the
 * deferred script initializes and attempts at most one exposure and click per
 * element and page load. Dynamically inserted links remain navigable but are
 * intentionally outside this measurement contract. No initial bridge cards on
 * the page == zero beacons.
