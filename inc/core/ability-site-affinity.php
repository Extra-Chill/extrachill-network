/**
 * Ability-to-site affinity resolution.
 *
 * ec_get_route_site_affinity() (see cross-site-rest.php) answers "which site
 * owns this REST route?" from a small, hand-maintained prefix map — route
 * prefixes partition cleanly by site. Ability names do not: on the live
 * network, 129 `extrachill/` abilities are registered on both main and events
 * while 120 are events-only, inside a single namespace. A static map would
 * rot on the next plugin change and fail silently (the ability would simply
 * appear not to exist). This file builds and caches a real index instead.
 *
 * Why the index cannot be built with switch_to_blog() alone: abilities are
 * registered by each plugin's own init/rest_api_init hooks, which only run
 * once per PHP process, for whichever plugins are active on the site that
 * bootstrapped THIS process. switch_to_blog() changes the DB/options context
 * but does not retroactively load a target site's per-site-activated plugins
 * (see ec_cross_site_rest_request_in_process()'s docblock for the identical
 * problem on the REST dispatch side). So:
 *
 * - The CURRENT site's abilities are read in-process via wp_get_abilities()
 *   — zero HTTP cost, always accurate for this process.
 * - Every OTHER site's abilities are read via a forced HTTP loopback GET to
 *   its own `/wp-abilities/v1/abilities` list route (paginated, trimmed to
 *   `_fields=name`), which bootstraps that site's own plugin stack and
 *   therefore its own registry. This reuses ec_cross_site_rest_request(); it
 *   does not change its dispatch behavior.
 *
 * Only REST-visible abilities (`show_in_rest => true`) are indexed. That
 * flag is also required by core's `/wp-abilities/v1/abilities/{name}/run`
 * route, which is the only dispatch path ec_cross_site_rest_request() knows
 * how to reach for an ability (see its `/run` special case). An ability
 * that isn't REST-visible cannot be invoked cross-site regardless of which
 * site owns it, so indexing it would answer a question no consumer can act
 * on.
 *
 * The built index is a raw name => {site_key => true} ownership map, cached
 * network-wide (global object-cache group — the data is the same regardless
 * of which site computed or reads it). ec_get_network_abilities() resolves
 * that raw map to a single owner per name: the `ec_ability_site_affinity_overrides`
 * filter wins first, then an unambiguous single owner, otherwise the name is
 * omitted — an ability registered on several sites with no override is not a
 * guess this primitive makes on a consumer's behalf.
