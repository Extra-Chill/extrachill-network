# extrachill-network Homeboy rig

Boots the full 11-site Extra Chill subdomain multisite network -- real
per-domain sites, every network and per-site plugin, and the shared theme --
inside a disposable WP Codebox WordPress Playground sandbox. It exists to gate
network-wide deploys (extrachill-network#223): verify the *combination* of
~30 independently-released components boots cleanly before treating a deploy
as safe, and to give any repo's CI or an agent session a way to reproduce a
cross-plugin fatal without touching production.

See [Extra-Chill/extrachill-network#223](https://github.com/Extra-Chill/extrachill-network/issues/223)
for the full spike history this rig's design is built on (domain-based
multisite topology, release-zip mounting, and the theme-remote-sourcing gap).

## What it boots

- **Topology** (`network-topology.json`): the 11 production sites as real
  `wp_insert_site()` records under `SUBDOMAIN_INSTALL`, sourced read-only from
  `wp site list` on extrachill.com. Sites are matched by **domain**, never by
  blog ID -- a fresh install assigns new sequential blog IDs, so nothing in
  this rig or a consumer's own scenarios should assume blog ID 4 is the artist
  platform, etc.
- **Components** (`components.json`): every network-active and per-site plugin
  plus the shared theme, each defaulting to its owning repository's **latest
  GitHub Release zip** (`.../releases/latest/download/<asset>.zip`) or, for
  WordPress.org-hosted third-party plugins, `downloads.wordpress.org`. The
  per-site/network activation matrix is data read read-only from production
  (`wp plugin list --fields=name,file`), not shell.
- **Activation**: wp-codebox's own `extra_plugins[].activate` can only pick
  "network-wide" or "whatever blog is current," which cannot express a real
  11-site matrix. Every plugin mounts with `activate: false`; a single
  `wordpress.run-php` workflow step applies the exact per-site/network
  activation matrix itself, with dependency-tolerant multi-pass retries (see
  "Activation ordering" below). Activation runs with hooks **enabled**
  (`activate_plugin(..., $silent = false)`): core skips
  `register_activation_hook` callbacks entirely in silent mode, which left
  the 2026-09-23 baseline looking green while no plugin table existed
  anywhere. The rig also loads `wp-admin/includes/upgrade.php` (so `dbDelta`
  is available to callbacks the way a real admin activation provides it) and
  re-fires each network-activated plugin's activation hook per site, because
  network activation fires it only once from the current site -- per-site
  setup on the other 10 sites otherwise never runs.
- **Baseline scenario**: after activation, one assertion step compares actual
  vs. expected active plugins per site; then one `wordpress.browser-probe` per
  site asserts no console/page errors and no WordPress critical-error screen
  (`.wp-die-message`) on an anonymous page load, routed through the sandbox
  with `network-policy=block` scoped to that site's own host. (An earlier
  server-side `wp_remote_get(home_url('/'))` check was removed: the domains
  are real production hostnames and Playground resolves PHP HTTP on the real
  internet, so it measured production, not the boot. See #308.)
- **Domain-ID alignment** (generated mu-plugin): a fresh install assigns new
  sequential blog IDs, but the network plugin set routes through
  `EC_BLOG_ID_*` constants (production's IDs: events = 7, newsletter = 9,
  ...). On every boot the rig generates `ec-network-domain-ids.php` from
  `network-topology.json` and mounts it into `mu-plugins/`; it resolves each
  `EC_BLOG_ID_*` constant **by domain** against the actual sites table on
  every request, so `ec_is_events_site()` and every cross-site route built on
  `ec_get_blog_id()` target the right site. Without it, the events-site
  identity silently lands on whichever site draws blog 7 (docs, on this
  topology). This is rig infrastructure, not a product workaround; the
  upstream fix is for `ec_get_blog_id()` to resolve by domain itself.
- **Sandbox compatibility** (generated mu-plugin, extrachill-network#302):
  `ec-network-sandbox-compat.php` covers the gaps every browser journey hits.
  (1) The sandbox serves http, but the network builds production `https://`
  URLs, so the file answers `ec_site_url_override` with each site's real home
  URL and downgrades network URLs in redirects, escaped links and REST
  responses to http. (2) SQLite has no MySQL advisory locks, so it answers
  `GET_LOCK`/`RELEASE_LOCK`/`IS_FREE_LOCK` with `1` (requests are serialized).
  (3) Redis is excluded, so the network's atomic abuse limiters (Extra Chill
  Users registration, extrachill-api public writes) would fail closed with a
  503; the file answers their store seams
  (`extrachill_users_registration_admitter`, `extrachill_api_rate_limit_store`)
  with a site-option counter (#299). These are infrastructure substitutes, not
  product behaviour. Redirects between the mapped domains and the fence that
  stops server-side HTTP from reaching the real production hostnames come
  from WP Codebox itself (v0.28.2+: Automattic/wp-codebox#2533, #2534), which
  the journeys workflow pins and the deploy gate requires.
- **Journeys** (optional): full user journeys -- seeded personas, real
  browser interactions, persona-oracle grading -- that run after the baseline
  when selected via `extrachill_journeys`. See "The journey contract" below.

## Running it

```bash
homeboy rig install <this repo checkout or its git URL>
homeboy rig lint extrachill-network
homeboy rig package lint <this repo checkout>
homeboy rig check extrachill-network
HOMEBOY_SETTINGS_JSON='{"extrachill_theme_source":"/absolute/path/to/extrachill-theme-checkout"}' \
  homeboy rig up extrachill-network
```

`extrachill_theme_source` is required for a real `up` (omit it for `check`'s
dry-run, which never mounts the theme). See "Theme sourcing" below for why
this is a local checkout path today, not a release zip.

### Settings this rig reads (`HOMEBOY_SETTINGS_JSON`)

| Key | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `extrachill_theme_source` | Absolute local theme checkout path, or (forward-compatible only, see below) an `https://…zip` URL. Required for a real `up`. |
| `extrachill_journeys` | Array of journey IDs from `journeys/` to run after the baseline, e.g. `["gardner-event-rsvp"]`. Unknown IDs, wrong schemas, undeclared site domains, or missing persona files fail recipe validation loudly. |
| `extrachill_journey_seed` | Optional deterministic seed string, passed through opaquely as `get_site_option('ec_rig_journey_seed')` for any selected journey's `seed.php` to consume when it needs a replayable, seeded case plan (e.g. `auth-multisite`'s fuzz plan). The rig never inspects or names what a journey does with it. |
| `extrachill_demo` | Set `true` to render selected demo-capable journeys as instructional videos. Requires WP Codebox >= `0.31.2` and ffmpeg on PATH. |
| `extrachill_component_source_overrides` | `{ "<slug>": "<local path or URL>" }`. Overrides one component's mount source, e.g. to test an unreleased branch of `extrachill-network` itself. |
| `extrachill_release_set` | `{ "<slug>": { "ref": "<tag>" } }`. Pins a GitHub-hosted component to an explicit release tag instead of `latest`. There is no resolver that turns a `homeboy/release-set/v1` manifest into these entries yet -- a caller wanting deploy-parity pinning composes this map itself (see extrachill-network#223's spike notes on why `release-set/v1` is a gate, not a resolver). |
| `extrachill_include_excluded_components` | Array of slugs from `components.json`'s `excludedComponents` list to force-include; requires a matching `extrachill_component_source_overrides` entry (no default source exists for those). |
| `wordpress_runtime_php_version` | Overrides the default `8.4` (production's actual PHP major.minor, verified read-only via `wp eval 'echo PHP_VERSION;'`). |
| `wordpress_runtime_prepare_steps` / `wordpress_runtime_post_steps` | Consumer-owned recipe steps inserted before/after this rig's own workflow (same contract as `wordpress-multisite-e2e`). |

## The journey contract

**Journeys live here. This rig is the only place a network boot / E2E
user-journey harness may live** (extrachill-network#291). Consumer repos do
not keep their own runners, recipes, persona fixtures, or journey workflows;
they are components of this boot and, when a journey must exercise
unreleased consumer code, callers pass that code through
`extrachill_component_source_overrides` -- never by adding scenario files to
the consumer repo.

A journey is a directory under `journeys/<journey-id>/`:

```
journeys/gardner-event-rsvp/
  journey.json   # the contract document (schema extrachill-network/journey/v1)
  seed.php       # optional: run-php step executed before the browser steps
  grade.php      # optional: run-php step executed after the browser steps
  README.md      # what the journey walks, seed decisions, evidence layout
  evidence/      # committed run artifacts: FINDINGS.md, screenshots, result JSON
```

Contract rules enforced by `run.mjs` and `tests/contract.test.mjs`:

- `schema` must be `extrachill-network/journey/v1`; `id` must match the
  directory name.
- `sites` is a non-empty array of **domains** from `network-topology.json`.
  Sites are resolved by domain, never by blog ID -- seed and grade scripts
  resolve their target site with `get_sites(['domain' => ...])`.
- Every browser step carries an absolute `http://<domain>/...` URL, and its
  `url`, `route-host`, and `allow-host` hosts must be inside the journey's
  declared `sites` (with `network-policy=block`, journey steps block all
  other egress).
- `persona.file` must exist in `personas/` (pinned canonical copies; see
  `personas/README.md`). Single-scenario fixture users are not personas and
  stay inside the journey's seed.
- `seed`/`grade` are `wordpress.run-php` `code-file` steps read from the
  journey directory at boot time; no mount of the journey directory is
  needed.
- `runtimeEnv` entries (e.g. `WP_AGENT_RUNTIME=1`, which forces Data
  Machine's full runtime -- and abilities registration -- on front-end
  requests) merge into the recipe inputs when the journey is selected.
- `fixtureMuPlugins` (optional): an array of journey-owned PHP files, mounted
  into `mu-plugins/` for the lifetime of the boot when that journey is
  selected. Use this when a journey needs a filter or stub active on EVERY
  request -- not just the process a single `seed`/`grade` run-php step
  runs in -- because a browser-driven flow (registration, delivery, ...)
  makes its own separate HTTP requests against the boot. The rig only
  mounts the file generically; the vendor-specific content (a Turnstile
  bypass filter, a provider HTTP stub, ...) lives entirely inside the
  journey's own file (`auth-multisite`'s Turnstile bypass,
  `gardner-social-operator`'s provider stub), never in this rig.
  Fixture mu-plugins are mounted for the whole boot, so they are visible to
  every journey selected alongside. A journey that asserts behaviour another
  journey's fixture stubs (e.g. the real Turnstile gate) must undo that stub
  in its own seed/grade.
- Steps run **after the full baseline** (activation, per-site assertion, and
  every site's anonymous browser probe), in the order the setting lists
  them; consumer `wordpress_runtime_post_steps` still run last.

Selecting journeys:

```bash
HOMEBOY_SETTINGS_JSON='{
  "extrachill_theme_source": "/path/to/extrachill-theme-checkout",
  "extrachill_journeys": ["gardner-event-rsvp"]
}' homeboy rig up extrachill-network
```

Testing unreleased consumer code remains a pure settings concern:

```bash
HOMEBOY_SETTINGS_JSON='{
  "extrachill_theme_source": "/path/to/extrachill-theme-checkout",
  "extrachill_journeys": ["gardner-event-rsvp"],
  "extrachill_component_source_overrides": { "extrachill-events": "/abs/worktree" }
}' homeboy rig up extrachill-network
```

Writing a new journey: copy the shape of `journeys/gardner-event-rsvp/`,
grade against the oracles of a pinned persona (or document why there is no
persona), commit curated evidence under `journeys/<id>/evidence/` (FINDINGS.md
plus screenshots plus the result JSON), and file every product finding in
the repo that owns it after a duplicate search. Keep the honest-outcomes
rule from the events repo journeys: a **finding** is a real product defect,
a **skip** is a runtime that could not fairly judge the case, and neither is
ever silently converted into a pass.

### Regression journeys in CI

`.github/workflows/journeys.yml` runs selected journeys nightly, on rig PRs,
and on demand (`workflow_dispatch` with a `journeys` JSON array). It boots
the network from latest releases and uploads the browser evidence. A journey
opts into regression semantics by pinning its known findings to issues in
its grade (see `journeys/musician-link-page-onboarding/README.md`), so a new
finding, or a pinned one that now passes, fails the run.

### Demo Mode

Any journey can opt into a walkthrough by declaring `demo.video` (`viewport`,
optional `size` and output dimensions/fps), `demo.presentation`, and a
`demo.theme` filename under `demo-themes/`. Keep annotations and captions in
the journey's own browser steps so regression and demo share the same journey
contract. Optional demo overlays reference markers on journey steps.

Set `extrachill_demo` to `true` when selecting a demo-capable journey. The run
uses the disposable rig and writes `evidence/demo/<journey>.mp4`. Manual
`journeys` workflow dispatch supports `demo: true`; nightly regression behavior
is unchanged. Install WP Codebox `0.31.2` or later and ffmpeg to render.

### Journeys ported from extrachill-events (extrachill-network#292)

The Events repo's entire `tests/wp-codebox/`, `tests/NetworkE2E/`, and
`tests/browser/*.evidence.js` E2E harnesses moved here and were deleted from
that repo, per this rig being the only home for network boot / E2E
user-journey harnesses (extrachill-network#291):

| Journey | Ported from (extrachill-events) |
| --- | --- |
| `gardner-venue-booking` | `tests/wp-codebox/gardner-venue-booking.json`, `-seed.php`, `-journey.php` |
| `booking-invariants` | `tests/NetworkE2E/booking/{topology.php,assert.php,run.mjs,action-model.json}`, `.github/workflows/booking-network-e2e.yml`, `docs/booking-network-e2e.md` |
| `venue-booking-console` | `tests/browser/{booking-inquiry,booking-correspondence,booking-form-preview,booking-setup-copy,booking-embed}.evidence.js` |
| `venue-claim-and-discovery` | `tests/browser/venue-claim-acquisition.evidence.js` + `venue-claim-archive-fixture.php`, `tests/browser/city-calendar-priority.evidence.js` |
| `near-me-and-my-shows` | `tests/browser/near-me.evidence.js` + `near-me-fixture.html`, `tests/browser/my-shows-registration.evidence.js` |

Every one of these originals ran against a mocked WordPress runtime, a
hand-authored static HTML fixture, or fake domains intercepted by Playwright
routes — none of them ever exercised a real WordPress request. See each
journey's own README for exactly what changed, what could not be ported for
real (Cloudflare Turnstile is unconfigured on this rig by default, so widget
children never render; SQLite has no real multi-connection race primitive;
canonical event conversion's MySQL-only `GET_LOCK` primitive is unavailable),
and what real product findings the port surfaced.

### Testing an unreleased extrachill-events branch against these journeys

extrachill-events keeps no scenarios, runners, personas, or bespoke E2E
workflows of its own (see "The journey contract" above) — a developer or CI
job on that repo runs this rig with `extrachill_component_source_overrides`
pointed at their checkout and `extrachill_journeys` selecting the Events
journeys that exercise their change:

```bash
HOMEBOY_SETTINGS_JSON='{
  "extrachill_theme_source": "/path/to/extrachill-theme-checkout",
  "extrachill_journeys": ["gardner-venue-booking", "booking-invariants", "venue-booking-console", "venue-claim-and-discovery", "near-me-and-my-shows"],
  "extrachill_component_source_overrides": { "extrachill-events": "/abs/path/to/your/extrachill-events/checkout" }
}' homeboy rig up extrachill-network
```

From extrachill-events' own CI, the reusable `homeboy-action` rig workflow
(already used by every other component's Homeboy-based gate) is the
~10-line integration point — call it with this rig's ID and the settings
above rather than adding a new bespoke workflow file.

The old "consumer-owned scenario" pattern (a consumer repo layering its own
`wordpress_runtime_post_steps` browser scenario onto this baseline) is
superseded: `wordpress_runtime_prepare_steps` / `wordpress_runtime_post_steps`
remain for arbitrary workflow-level composition, but user journeys belong in
this directory.

## Activation ordering

`components.json` does not hand-order plugins by dependency (WooCommerce
before extrachill-shop, etc.) -- that's fragile the moment any component adds
a new "Requires Plugins" header or runtime check. Instead, `run.mjs`'s
activation step retries the pending list across multiple passes per site and
network-wide: each pass activates whatever's dependencies are already
satisfied, and the loop only throws once a full pass makes zero progress
(i.e., a real, non-ordering failure remains). This was hit and fixed live
during this rig's own verification run (`extrachill-shop` requires
WooCommerce to already be active).

## Theme sourcing (documented gap)

`wp_codebox_extra_themes` / `inputs.extra_themes` accepts a remote
`https://…zip` source as of
[Automattic/wp-codebox#2519](https://github.com/Automattic/wp-codebox/pull/2519)
(merged into wp-codebox `main` 2026-09-21 as v0.27.0, itself born from
[homeboy-extensions#2857](https://github.com/Extra-Chill/homeboy-extensions/issues/2857)
filed during this rig's own spike). The wp-codebox CLI installed on this host
is v0.28.2, so both sourcing modes below are available. One caveat drove the
rig's default: wp-codebox's own `extra_themes` activation is not
multisite-aware (it does not `switch_theme()` on every created site), while
the local-mount path carries a rig-owned activation step that switches the
theme on all 11 sites. A network boot therefore uses the local checkout path;
the remote zip path stays supported for single-site consumers of the rig.

`run.mjs` auto-detects which mode to use from `extrachill_theme_source`:

- An `https://…zip` URL is passed straight through to `inputs.extra_themes`.
  Works on wp-codebox v0.27.0+; note the multisite activation caveat above.
- Anything else is treated as a local checkout path and mounted as a readonly
  directory the same way `wordpress-multisite-e2e`'s own `run.mjs` already
  does, with a workflow step that `switch_theme()`s every created site.

There is deliberately **no default** for `extrachill_theme_source` on a real
`up` -- callers must supply a checkout of `Extra-Chill/extrachill` (or, once
the CLI updates, its release zip). `homeboy rig check`'s dry-run validates
cleanly without it (no theme mount at all in that mode).

## Excluded components (documented, not silent)

`components.json`'s `excludedComponents` list is the honest inventory of
production plugins this rig does **not** mount by default, and why:

| Slug | Site(s) in production | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `wp-codebox` | network | This rig runs the whole network inside a WP Codebox sandbox; mounting the WP Codebox WordPress companion plugin inside its own disposable sandbox is self-referential and out of scope. |
| `chubes-gallery-lightbox` | network | No GitHub Release and not on WordPress.org -- no zip to source. |
| `wp-coding-agents-integration` | extrachill.com | Agent-runtime development tooling, not network product code. |
| `intelligence` | studio.extrachill.com | Private repository with no public source (NETWORK-ARCHITECTURE.MD: "the installed repository is not publicly linkable"). |
| `mediavine-control-panel` | extrachill.com, events.extrachill.com, wire.extrachill.com | Proprietary vendor plugin with no public zip. |
| `redis-cache` | network | Requires a Redis server the disposable runtime does not run. Its activation hook (which the rig now fires for real) installs the `object-cache.php` drop-in; with no Redis reachable, every persistent option read fails through to defaults and the boot breaks. Production runs Redis; the sandbox documents the exclusion instead of pretending. |

Force-include one with `extrachill_include_excluded_components` +
`extrachill_component_source_overrides` if you have a private/local source for
it.

## Boundary

Like `wordpress-multisite-e2e`, this rig does not claim cross-domain cookie
parity -- `crossDomainCookieParity` is `"not-claimed"` in wp-codebox's own
site-seed topology evidence, and production doesn't rely on it either (cross-site
auth goes through auth.extrachill.com / wp-native Auth, not a shared session
cookie; there is no `COOKIE_DOMAIN` constant in production's `wp-config.php`).
`extrachill.link`'s homepage is expected to return either 200 or 404 (see
`network-topology.json`'s `expectedHomepageStatusNote`): `extrachill-artist-platform`
renders it through link-page routing that requires a provisioned link page, so
a brand-new disposable site with no seeded content 404s exactly like an
unclaimed slug would in production.
