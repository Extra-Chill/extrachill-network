/**
 * Guard: every tests/*.php file must be reachable by a real execution path.
 *
 * #254: a third of tests/*.php were registered nowhere and never ran, while
 * still reading as coverage. This script is the gate that stops that
 * recurring: a new file dropped into tests/ without being wired in fails
 * the check instead of silently doing nothing.
 *
 * A tests/*.php file counts as reachable when it is:
 *
 *   1. Auto-discovered by the managed PHPUnit runner's default convention
 *      (`*Test.php` suffix or `test-*` prefix — see the WordPress
 *      extension's docs/TESTING.md "Requirements" section), OR
 *   2. Declared in homeboy-test-manifest.json under `tests`
 *      (`standalone-php` or `wordpress` environment), OR
 *   3. Required, by literal relative-path reference, from another
 *      tests/*.php file that is itself reachable by (1) or (2) — a child
 *      probe spawned by its caller (e.g. FoundationBootstrapProbe.php is
 *      exec()'d from bootstrap-architecture-smoke.php), not a standalone
 *      top-level entry point.
 *
 * Scope is intentionally the flat tests/*.php directory, not recursive:
 * subdirectories such as tests/browser/ hold Playground browser-session
 * fixtures invoked manually through wp-codebox tooling, not files that
 * ever run through a `homeboy review test` gate at all.
 *
 * Run: php tools/check-test-registration.php
 *
 * @package ExtraChillNetwork
